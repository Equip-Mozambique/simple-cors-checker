# simple-cors-checker
Just a basic implementation of CORS testing purpose - It's more of a basic helper to Backend Devs while developing an API.
You can use it, in need for testing the endpoints and avoid getting CORS while on production ("very annoying").

My little tweaks on the idea:
- Now working with GET Method only
- Added a Form with an input
- Organized success and error messages on the page
- Check the returned data on the page and also on the console.
